# Bubble-Blowing-Robot
A robot that blows bubbles

This repository is the documentation of the creation of the bubble-blowing robot. The design was to create an autonomous bubble-blowing robot but was altered to be more dependent. The machine will use motors to dip a bubble wand into bubble solution and then manuever it to a fan which will blow the bubble. Also comes equipped with wheels to transport itself. Currently only moves straight, but changes are to come soon.
